{"name":"neon-color-scheme","theme":"syntax","version":"1.0.0","description":"A colorful bright-on-black syntax color theme for Atom. Its aim is to make as many languages as possible look as good as possible.","keywords":["syntax","theme"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/MattDMo/neon-color-scheme-atom-syntax"},"license":"MIT","engines":{"atom":">=1.0.0 <2.0.0"},"readme":"# neon-color-scheme-atom-syntax theme\n\n### or, just \"Neon\" is fine\n\nThis is a port of the popular [Neon Color Scheme](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Neon%20Color%20Scheme) for [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com/3) to the Atom editor. I've removed all the grossly Sublime-specific stuff like SublimeLinter and AAAPackageDev scopes, just because they aren't necessary, but I haven't done too much fiddling at this point, other than to tweak how selections look. I'm fairly new to Atom, so bear with me as I learn how to do things better. This is also my first real foray into LESS, so I'm learning all sorts of things as I go here.\n\n## Peeves/Bugs (so far)\n\n* I don't know if this is Atom's fault or mine, but when a scope has `background-color` set, the various `@selection` selectors just don't work - for example, open this file in Atom, and try to select a regular word. See how pretty that looks? Now, try to select part of or the whole URL for one of the links in the first section - you don't see a thing. Is there any way to fix that?\n* There seem to be some colors defined somewhere like `@red`, `@yellow`, etc., but I don't know *where* they're defined or how to change them. Any guesses?\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you haven't figured out so far, I'm learning as I go here, as Sublime is (and will probably remain) my primary editor.
